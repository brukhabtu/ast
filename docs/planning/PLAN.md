# AST - LLM Codebase Navigation Library

## Project Overview
AST is a Python library designed to help Large Language Models (LLMs) navigate and understand codebases quickly and efficiently. By providing high-level abstractions over Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and code analysis, it enables LLMs to explore code without reading entire files.

## Core Components

### 1. AST Parser & Walker
- Parse Python files into AST nodes
- Traverse AST with visitor patterns
- Extract node positions (file:line:column)
- Support for partial parsing on syntax errors

### 2. Symbol Indexer
- Extract all function/class/variable definitions
- Build symbol tables with locations
- Support quick lookups by name
- Track symbol visibility (public/private)

### 3. Import Analyzer
- Map import relationships
- Build dependency graphs
- Trace import chains
- Detect circular dependencies

### 4. Definition Finder
- Find where symbols are defined
- Jump to implementation
- Handle multiple definitions
- Support for dynamic definitions

### 5. Reference Finder
- Find all usages of a symbol
- Track variable/function/class references
- Cross-file reference tracking
- Distinguish between read/write references

### 6. Call Graph Builder
- Map function call relationships
- Identify callers/callees
- Visualize call hierarchies
- Support for method calls and dynamic dispatch

### 7. Type Analyzer
- Extract type hints/annotations
- Infer types where possible
- Track type relationships
- Support for generic types

### 8. Pattern Matcher
- Search for code patterns
- Support AST-based queries
- Find similar code structures
- Regex-like pattern matching on AST

## Performance & Scalability

### Incremental Parsing
- Only reparse changed files
- Track file modifications
- Maintain parse state between sessions

### Caching Layer
- Store parsed ASTs
- Cache symbol tables
- Persist analysis results
- Memory-efficient storage

### Lazy Loading
- Parse files on-demand
- Stream large codebases
- Minimal memory footprint

### Parallel Processing
- Multi-threaded parsing
- Concurrent analysis
- Handle large codebases efficiently

## Context Understanding

### Docstring Extractor
- Parse function/class documentation
- Extract parameter descriptions
- Support multiple docstring formats (Google, NumPy, Sphinx)

### Comment Parser
- Extract inline comments
- Associate comments with code
- Parse TODO/FIXME markers

### Scope Analyzer
- Understand variable scopes
- Track closures and nested functions
- Resolve name bindings

### Decorator Analysis
- Track decorators and their effects
- Understand decorator chains
- Support for custom decorators

## Code Intelligence

### Signature Extractor
- Function parameters and defaults
- Return type annotations
- Support for *args and **kwargs

### Dead Code Detector
- Find unused symbols
- Identify unreachable code
- Track import usage

### Complexity Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Nesting depth
- Lines of code metrics
- Maintainability index

### Control Flow Graph
- Track execution paths
- Identify branches and loops
- Support for exception handling

## Change Tracking

### Diff Analyzer
- Compare ASTs between versions
- Identify structural changes
- Track refactorings

### Impact Analysis
- Find affected code by changes
- Dependency impact assessment
- Test coverage mapping

### Hot Spot Detection
- Frequently changed areas
- Code churn metrics
- Identify unstable components

## Integration Features

- Progressive results
- Event-driven architecture

### Query Language
- Simple DSL for AST queries
- SQL-like syntax
- Composable queries

### Export Formats
- JSON for programmatic access

- Markdown reports

## Error Handling

### Partial Parsing
- Continue on syntax errors
- Best-effort analysis
- Graceful degradation

### Recovery Strategies
- Error isolation
- Fallback mechanisms
- Diagnostic information

### Diagnostic Reports
- Clear error messages
- Suggested fixes
- Context information

## API Design Principles

1. **Fast First** - Optimize for speed over completeness
2. **Fail Gracefully** - Never crash on bad input
3. **Stream Results** - Return partial results early
4. **Cache Aggressively** - Minimize redundant parsing
5. **Simple Interface** - Easy to use for LLM integration
